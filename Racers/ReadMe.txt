A Racer object will either be a slow but steady racer or a fast and curious racer.

A slow but steady racer always moves forward but only moves one or two positions each turn. 

A fast and curious racer moves one to four positions for each turn but can go forward and backwards. 

The Racer objects move along a straight race track of a given size moving forward (and backwards if appropriated) 
taking turns until one the objects wins (gets to the last position of the track). 

Continues to read in numbers representing direction/move for each racer until a winner is declared. 

Then prints out the String with the pairs of direction/moves for each racer and who won (or tied) and in (n) number of turns.
