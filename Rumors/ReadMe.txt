Adapts a Node class with strings for data: 

The first String is called teller, and  this holds the name of the person who tells the rumour. 
The second String is called listener, and this holds the name of the person who hears the rumour.

After a person hears a rumour, they may tell another person the rumour (i.e., become a ‘teller’).

A person who spreads a rumour will only tell ONE person the same rumour (i.e., a person will only tell at least one more person the same rumour).

It returns an ArrayList that contains the tracing of names that heard or told a rumor.
