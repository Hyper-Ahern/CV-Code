Use the given UML and description of methods to define the Triangle2D program
Then create a Triangle2DDemo class to create and use Triangle2D objects. The demo class contains the main method. 
Use a Scanner object to read the attributes for six Point objects then create two Triangle2D objects (three points each) from a Scanner object.
Print the attributes of both Triangle objects (using the toString method).
Read in two more integers and create one more Point object and then have both Triangle2D objects call their contains method with the Point object
See if the first triangle contains the second triangle (first triangle calls the method with the second triangle as the parameter).
See if the second triangle contains the first triangle
See if the two triangles overlap each other
